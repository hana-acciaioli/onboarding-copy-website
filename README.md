<!-- My wireframe got a little out of control. -->

### The ORIGINAL plan:

1.  HTML (using CSS grid)

    1. Create two sections> header: 100% 30px high, products: 80%, 2000px high.
    2. Create 10 rows within product section, all 200px high
    3. Create columns withing rows!
    4. create rows within columns!
    5. maybe create more columns
    6. add photos

    ### What I ended up doing instead:

        1. Created two sections: ROWS instead of columns
        2. Created 3 columns for product (sides are blank)
        3. created many rows within the center column
        4. created columns and lists within the rows
